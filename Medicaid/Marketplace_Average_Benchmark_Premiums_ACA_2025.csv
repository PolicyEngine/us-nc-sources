Notes,
"Premiums were analyzed using the second-lowest cost silver (benchmark) premium for a 40-year-old in each county and weighted by county plan selections, including premiums for non-Essential Health Benefits. In some state-based marketplaces, the premium data for some years are at the rating area level or zip level and are mapped to counties before weighting by county plan selections.",
